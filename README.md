# Keycap

Simple note-taking app with support for markdown. Share your thoughts with others and organize them into folders.

## Why?

After months of using Windows and Android, I found out that notes aren't syncing and there isn't any support for markdown. But you may ask, Why build another Notion? and the answer will be pretty simple. With this project, I developed my skills and learned something new. Also, Keycap will load much faster than Notion, and it won't update itself in the most unsuitable time ðŸ™ƒ.

## Stack

- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/)
- [Cockroach DB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/)

## Todo

- [x] custom `ctrl+k` search
- [x] commands through `ctrl+k`
- [x] add support for renaming __folders__
- [x] OAuth with Google and GitHub?
- [x] show notes via sharable links
- [ ] code highlighting
- [ ] work without internet (kinda working, if the page is still cached, notes and folders will be loaded from local copies)
- [ ] create landing page
- [x] create project logo

## Notes

- [Prisma vs Drizzle (my benchmark)](./benchmarks/prisma-vs-drizzle/README.md)
  tldr: Prisma even manages to beat drizzle in some queries (at least on my local machine)

- [Prisma vs Kysely (my benchmark)](./benchmarks/prisma-vs-kysely/README.md)
  tldr: in queries without joins prisma is not that far, but in larger queries, Kysely has usually more than 100 ops/s difference

<!-- [Rewrite with kysely](https://github.com/logotip4ik/keycap/tree/feat/kysely). Kysely is slightly faster in a development environment, -->
<!-- though `node-postgres` isn't well suited for serverless. So to see Kysely outperforms Prisma you will need much more traffic than a few visitors in a week. -->

- With migrating to kysely, the overall memory usage dropped significantly (something like -100mb)

- Tested node vs bun vs deno perf, and results are quite interesting (testing command `bombardier -c 200 -d 60s -la`):
    1. So the most performant is node, +-80000 rps, but it has little memory leak...
    2. Bun takes second place with +-79000 rps, although it's memory is rock solid
    3. Last one is deno, +-75000 rps (it is still very good result), but it also has a memory leak, so V8 is doing some weird stuff here Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

### Load testing with Bombardier

Firstly build the project in bench config: `yarn build:bench`, then test command itself:

```sh
bombardier http://localhost:3000/api/notes/main -l -d 60s -c 300
```

> [!NOTE]
